# Photo Album - Simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) project in ReactJs.
A simple CRUD application built with react, node and mysql for the purpose of study. 

As a CRUD should work, the application allows the user to insert photos and edit them in a virtual Photo Album.  
The main goal of this project was to understand how to connect a back-end database with a front-end web page.  
For the front-end development I used JavaScript, with ReactJS and NodeJS, and the back-end was built on MySQL.

I intend with this project to solidify my knowledge of these technologies to be able to build and cooperate in projects as a full-stack developer.
